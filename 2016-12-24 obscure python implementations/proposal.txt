Title: Obscure Python Implementations

Duration: 20 minutes

Description:

When people talk about using Python, they are usually
referring to the most common *implementation* of Python - CPython.
Some talk about using PyPy or Jython or IronPython. 

In this talk, I'd like to present some of the more obscure python implementations,
the ones that only very few might have heard about and also talk about their features and
the reasons for which you might want to use them.

Amendment: Since I want to talk about the very obscure ones, I might talk about defunct implementations
also. So for those cases it might not make sense to talk about good reasons to use them (beyond just
playing around with them for fun).

Title: Do they have control?

Description: I want to ask a question: Do they have control? Before I elaborate on this question, I will talk briefly about the privacy issues that we face everyday and the actions we take in response. I will also talk about how these issues affect the vulnerable among us. And hopefully by the end it will be clear what I mean when I ask the question.
I offer no solutions in this talk. I only hope to bring a particular issue to the forefront.
